An effective algorithm for Encryption and Decryption of messages using Graph Theory

## Overview
This project focuses on using Graph theory to create a secure and effective algorithm for encryption and decryption of messages. This algorithm can encrypt short messages to produce highly secure cipher text which can only be received by the intended receiver. The report contains complete information of the algorithm along with appropriate illustrations. The attached cpp file contains the actual code in C++ corresponding to the algorithm.
